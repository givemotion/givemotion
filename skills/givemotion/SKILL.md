# givemotion: HTML in, video out

A composition is one HTML file. Every frame is that page at a moment in time. CSS animations, transitions, Web Animations, timers, `requestAnimationFrame`, canvas and WebGL all run on a virtual clock, so what you write renders frame-exact and identically every time. No script tag or import is needed: the runtime (`window.gm`) and a preset stylesheet are injected for you.

This file is the core (read it all). Then read **only** the 1-3 technique recipes your video needs (table at the end): each one shows how a professional builds that effect, with numbers and a working example. Look up anything else when you need it.

## The loop

0. **Plan.** Read the brief. Pick the recipes it needs. Write a shot list as a comment at the top of the HTML, one line per moment: time range, what is on screen, how it moves, how it hands over to the next moment.
1. **Write** the composition (`video.html`).
2. `npx givemotion check video.html`: fix every ✖ error; fix ⚠ warnings (real faults: text cut off, overlapping, unreadable) unless you meant it. ℹ notes are style hints (a straight path, one easing everywhere, the camera pausing): look at the frames and ignore them when the move is what you meant. Do not spend rounds making check quiet; spend them making the video look better. The report starts with a motion strip, one mark per half second (`▁` little changes, `█` the whole picture changes).
3. `npx givemotion snapshot video.html`: **open `snapshots/sheet.png` and look at it** with a designer's eye. To judge one move, `snapshot --every 0.1 --from 2 --to 3`. Fix and repeat 2-3.
4. `npx givemotion render video.html -o out/video.mp4`.

`--json` on any command for machine output; `<command> --help` for options. `still video.html -t 3.2 -o f.png` renders one moment; `inspect --at 4.5 --el "#logo"` says where an element is then.

## How good motion is made here

The engine gives you any HTML/CSS/SVG/canvas and a frame-exact timeline; the look comes from how you choreograph it. Blind viewers preferred videos where every element was choreographed by hand over videos built from one-word presets.

1. **Choreograph by hand.** Use `gm.timeline` for anything that matters: explicit start times, per-move easing (a fast `expo.out` slam, a soft `sine.inOut` drift, a `back.out(1.6)` landing), offsets of 40-120 ms between related parts. Presets (`data-enter`, `data-camera`) are fine for small supporting things.
2. **Three layers on every hero moment:** the main move; secondary detail that sells it (blur while fast, a glow, a shadow that grows, follow-through, a ring or particles on impact); and ambient motion so the frame is never frozen (drifting background, slow camera push).
3. **Contrast in timing.** Fast in, slow settle; holds of 0.4-1 s after something lands; exits shorter than entrances. Never move everything at the same speed with the same curve.
4. **Follow the brief exactly** for colors, fonts, copy, sizes and timing; your craft goes into how things move, not into extra content.
5. **Frame 0 is the hook**, nothing is cut by the frame edge, text is big (titles 96-200 px, body ≥ 36 px at 1080p), one hero per moment, scenes flow into each other (push, whip, morph, match cut) rather than fading.
6. **Things come from things.** A new element is born from one already on screen, not spawned from nowhere: three circles squeeze out of the main circle; one of the rectangles on screen slides over and becomes the underline; a card grows out of the button that was clicked; the logo's mark becomes the end card's mark. Reuse and transform before you add.
7. **A camera move means "look here".** Push in only toward something the viewer should read next. Never zoom into empty space or into the old scene as a way to transition: to leave a scene, move sideways (push, whip, wipe) or carry an element across (morph, the rule above).
8. **Animate** `transform`/`translate`/`scale`/`rotate`/`opacity`/`filter`/`clip-path`, not `width`/`top`/`left`.

## Hierarchy: one thing matters at a time

Viewers preferred videos where the eye always knew where to look.
- **Every line has a key word.** Give the word that carries the meaning contrast: the accent color, a heavier weight, a bigger size, or a highlight/underline drawn on. The rest of the line stays quieter (ink or muted color, lighter weight). One per line, at most two per screen. If everything is accent, nothing is.
- **Every moment has one hero:** the biggest, brightest thing with the most motion. Support is clearly smaller (hero ≥ 1.6× the next size; three levels at most: hero, support, label), dimmer (muted color or 50-70% opacity), arrives after the hero and moves less.
- **Lead the eye in order:** the hero lands first; the key word changes color or gets its underline on its own beat (0.2-0.4 s after the line settles); support follows. When the camera or a callout focuses on something, dim or blur the rest.
- **Use the brief's palette roles strictly:** accent colors for emphasis only, muted for secondary text.

## Easing: match the curve to the motion

- **Entering** decelerates (ease-out: `expo.out`, `power3.out`, or `back.out(1.4)` when it lands with weight).
- **Leaving** accelerates (ease-in: `power2.in`), shorter than the entrance (60-70%).
- **Moving from A to B** while visible, camera moves, a scale change of something already on screen: ease-in-out (`power2.inOut`, `sine.inOut`): it starts gently and lands gently.
- **Ambient drift:** long `sine.inOut`; `linear` only for loops (spins, tickers). Nothing that starts or stops on screen moves linearly.
- Leave `ease` out and the engine already does this (entrances spring in, moves ease in and out, exits ease in); when you set one, follow the rules above.

Built-in fonts (no files needed): `Inter`, `JetBrains Mono`, `Playfair Display`, `Space Grotesk`, `Bebas Neue`, `Caveat`. A brief's own font files load with `@font-face` from their path.

## Timing model (read this)

- Settings live on `<html>`: `data-width`, `data-height` (even numbers), `data-fps` (default 30), optional `data-duration`, optional `data-background`.
- Times are seconds: `1.5`, `1.5s`, `500ms`, `45f` (frames), `1:02.5`.
- **Clips.** An element with `data-start`, `data-duration` or `data-end` only exists (is `display`ed) from start to start+duration. Times are relative to its parent clip. Elements without timing are always there.
- **Video length** = `data-duration` on `<html>`, otherwise the end of the last clip.
- **Sequences.** `data-sequence` on a container plays its children one after another. Every child needs `data-duration`, or give the container `data-cuts="0 2.13 4.27"` (when each child starts; also `"beats: 0 4 8"` / `"bars: 0 1 2"`). `data-gap="0.2"` (negative = overlap). `data-transition="<name> <seconds> [easing]"` overlaps neighbours and animates the change; a child can set its own `data-transition` (how it comes in). **Each transition takes its length off the total**: 3 scenes of 4s with `fade 0.5` last 11s. Cuts on the beat, `data-cut-align`, and where a scene's time 0 then sits: `references/timeline.md`.
- **Transitions:** `push-left/right/up/down` (new pushes old out) `cover-left/right/up/down` (new slides over) `whip-left/right/up/down` (fast, blurred) `wipe-left/right/up/down` `diagonal` `clock` `iris` `zoom` `zoom-through` (the old scene flies past the camera) `flip` (3D) `dip` (through black) `blur` `fade-up` `fade`, and **`morph`**: elements with the same `data-morph="name"` in both scenes fly and resize from the old place to the new one while the rest crossfades. Use it to carry a logo, card, number or shape into the next scene. Inside one scene, use `gm.fly` instead.
- **CSS animations run on clip time.** `animation: fade-up .6s .4s both` starts .4s after its clip appears. Use `both` (or `backwards`) fill so the element is hidden before its delay.
- **Something appears later inside a long scene** (one camera world, one whiteboard): the delay in `data-enter` counts from the start of the element's clip, so `data-enter="write 0.8 11.9"` writes a label 11.9 s into the scene and keeps it hidden until then. No extra clip needed.
- `gm.onFrame(fn)` gets the **video's** time, even inside a scene; `gm.onFrame('#s', (local, info, el) => …)` counts from `#s`'s start, like `gm.timeline('#s')`.
- Timers, `requestAnimationFrame`, `Date.now()`, `performance.now()` are virtual and `Math.random()` is seeded. Normal web animation code just works.

## Timeline: precise choreography (GSAP-style, built in)

For anything with more than a few moving parts, use `gm.timeline`: the GSAP API you know, but every value is computed from the time, so it renders frame-exact and in parallel. Times are seconds **relative to the clip that contains the scope**.

```js
gm.timeline('#scene2')                                     // scope: selectors are looked up inside it
  .from('.title .gm-word', { y: 120, opacity: 0, rotate: 8, stagger: 0.06 })   // no ease: springs in
  .to('.card', { x: 400, y: -60, scale: 1.2 }, '+=0.3')                 // arcs, sized to the distance
  .fromTo('.bar', { scaleY: 0 }, { scaleY: 1, stagger: { each: 0.08, from: 'center' } }, '<')
  .to('#line', { draw: 1, duration: 1.5 }, 2)                       // draw an SVG stroke
  .to('.price', { textContent: 249, duration: 1.5 }, 2.5);          // count a number
gm.fly('#event', { from: '#slot2', at: 7.5, duration: 0.8 });      // fly from another element's box into its own place
```
`from()`/`fromTo()` show their start values from the beginning of the clip (keeps things hidden until they enter). When tweens overlap on the same property, the one that started last wins. Positions, all props and options, labels, keyframes, `gm.fly` and SVG caveats: `references/timeline.md`.

Also built in (tables in `references/api.md`): `data-enter`/`data-exit` presets, `data-split`, `data-stagger`, `data-count`, `data-type` (typewriter), `data-scramble`, `data-camera` (push, float, shake…), `data-parallax`, `data-morph`, `data-fit`, `data-pulse`, easing names (GSAP names work), preset CSS keyframes and `var(--px)`, and ready-made blocks (`npx givemotion blocks`: captions, code-window, cursor, browser-window, charts…).
