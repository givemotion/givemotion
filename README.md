# givemotion: make videos with AI, free and open source

**Ask your AI for a video. Get an MP4.** givemotion is a free, open-source (MIT) video engine made for AI
coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor and Codex. Your agent writes the video as a web page, checks it, looks at
it, fixes it and renders it. When you want one thing changed, the agent changes that one thing and only that part
of the video is rendered again. No license fees, no seats, no per-render costs, no account, and you can fork it
and make it your own.

Created by [Leonardo Grigorio](https://github.com/leonardogrig) as an independent project. Website:
[givemotion.org](https://givemotion.org). (Formerly called motionwright.)

If you are looking for a **free, open-source way to make videos with code**, to **make videos with Claude Code**, or an
**AI motion graphics tool you can run in your own project**, this is it.

## Try it in 1 minute

In your project folder:

```bash
npx givemotion init my-video
```

This creates a starter video and installs the instructions your agent needs. Then just ask your agent:

> "Make a 20-second launch video for our app. Use our logo and colors, and put music under it."

The agent writes the video, runs the checks, looks at the frames, fixes what is wrong, and renders
`out/video.mp4`. You can watch and scrub it live with `npx givemotion dev my-video`.

Then ask for changes the way you would ask a motion designer: "make the title blue", "hold the chart two seconds
longer". The agent edits the page and renders again, and only the parts of the video that changed are redone.

Already have a project? `npx givemotion skill` adds just the agent instructions: a skill pack (a short
`SKILL.md` plus topic files the agent reads when it needs them) in `.claude/skills/givemotion/` for Claude Code and
`.agents/skills/givemotion/` for Codex, and a section in `AGENTS.md` for Cursor and other agents. Run it again after
updating givemotion; `npx givemotion doctor` tells you when the installed pack is older than the engine.

Other ways to install the skill:

- Claude Code plugin: `/plugin marketplace add givemotion/givemotion`, then `/plugin install givemotion@givemotion`
- Skills CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and more): `npx skills add givemotion/givemotion`

**You need:** Node.js 20+ and ffmpeg. Chrome is downloaded for you (`npx givemotion install`).

## What you can make

- Product launch videos and app promos (with a cursor that really clicks the right button)
- Explainers with a camera that moves over a map, a diagram or a whole UI
- Hand-drawn whiteboard (Excalidraw-style) explainers: sketchy shapes and arrows that draw themselves on, handwriting
- Animated charts and data stories, from your own JSON data
- Vertical shorts for TikTok, Reels and YouTube Shorts, with word-by-word captions
- Code explainers for developer channels
- Logo stings, title cards, lower thirds, end cards
- Many personalized videos from one template (a different name, number or logo in each)
- Transparent overlays to drop into Premiere, DaVinci Resolve or Final Cut

## Same brief, four models

Each model got the same one-page brief ("The last lighthouse": a 15 s cinematic title sequence, night sea, a light
beam that carries into the title) and only this project's docs.

## Why it exists

I started givemotion because of how AI video models handle changes. When one detail is wrong, you ask again and
the model makes the whole video again, and something else often comes out different. With code, a change is an edit:
the agent changes one color or one timing and everything else stays exactly as it was. I wanted an engine built
around that loop, where the agent writes, checks, looks and fixes, and where a small fix costs a small render.

I also wanted it to be free for everyone without conditions. Companies of any size, agencies, people building their
own video tools on top of it: MIT allows all of that, including selling a modified copy.

It's an independent project, not tied to any company, and it's young. It gets better in rounds: fresh agents make
real videos from the docs, I read where they got stuck, and the engine is fixed. What it can't do yet is listed
below, next to what it can.

## Why it works well with AI agents

Most video tools were made for people. AI agents work differently, so givemotion is built around how they actually
behave, and we test it with real agents instead of guessing.

**1. Change one thing, render one part.** A render is split into fixed parts of 1 to 2 seconds, each with a
fingerprint of everything that can affect its pixels. Render again after an edit and only the parts whose fingerprint
changed are redone. Edit one scene and only that scene's parts are rendered; in one long scene, an edit to something
that first appears at 40 s keeps the first 40 s. The result is byte-identical to a full render. Neither HyperFrames
nor Remotion reuses unchanged parts on its own (Remotion can render a frame range you pick by hand). There are limits:
a script that reads the whole page, for example, turns the finer reuse inside a long scene off, and the render
report says why.

**2. It uses what AI already knows best: web pages.** A video is one HTML file with normal CSS and JavaScript.
Models have seen billions of web pages, so they write them well. In our test, 12 Claude agents made the same 4 videos
in plain HTML, in HTML with ready-made blocks, and in React; blind AI judges ranked plain HTML first in 6 of 8 cases,
with React a little behind ([the experiment](docs/experiments/2026-10-format-test.md)). That's a small test, and
it agrees with outside research (DesignBench, 2025) that models do best with plain HTML and CSS. React still works
if you want it. HyperFrames also uses plain HTML; Remotion uses React.

**3. The agent can check its own work.** An agent can't watch a video, so the engine does it for them:
- `check` finds text that is cut off, off screen, covered, overlapping, too small or hard to read, lines running
  through labels, two scenes' text smudged together in a transition, broken files and script errors, and says how
  to fix each one. It knows the difference between text that is *moving* past the edge and text that is *stuck* there.
- It also flags pacing: long stretches where nothing happens, a dead end card, an empty opening, an element that
  leaves before you could read it, or a camera move that only arrives after its scene has started to leave.
- It prints a "motion strip", a one-line picture of the video's rhythm.

**4. It picks the frames worth looking at.** `snapshot` reads the timeline and chooses the moments itself: each scene
once its entrances are done and before it starts to leave, and each camera shot once the camera has arrived. It puts
them in one image, so the agent sees the whole video in one look instead of guessing timestamps. `analyze` does the
same for any video file, including a reference you want to match, and `--compare` lists how yours differs.

**5. Motion design, not slides.** The tools that make video feel like animation are built in, so the agent doesn't
have to write them: a camera that follows and frames things, motion along paths, shape morphs, shared elements that
fly from one scene into the next, more than 25 scene transitions, kinetic type, particle bursts, live data charts the
camera can ride, hand-drawn sketch shapes and arrows that draw themselves on, labels that stay attached to their
shapes, and cuts and pulses that land on the music's beats. In our test against Remotion, the givemotion agents
wrote a median of 240 lines per video and the Remotion agents 617, mostly because they had to build a camera, beat
detection and hand-drawn shapes themselves.

**6. Natural motion by default.** Entrances spring in and settle, diagonal moves travel on a slight arc, exits
accelerate away, and the camera moves like an operator (back-to-back shots flow into one move, `follow` trails its
target and settles). `<html data-motion="classic">` brings back plain curves. We are still working out how to
measure whether viewers see the difference; so far our AI judges, who look at stills, don't.

**7. The know-how of a motion designer, in the agent's docs.** The skill pack has a short core plus files the
agent reads only when it needs them: 15 technique recipes (kinetic type, camera moves, scene transitions, logo
reveals, charts, UI demos, hand-drawn...), each checked by rendering it; 8 ready-made looks (palette, fonts,
background, motion personality); and guides for 9 kinds of video. Six fonts are built in (Inter, JetBrains Mono,
Playfair Display, Space Grotesk, Bebas Neue, Caveat), so a video looks the same on every machine.

**8. Built from what agents struggled with.** We give fresh agents only the docs and a real brief, read their
notes on what got in their way, and fix the engine, not just the instructions. In the latest full round, 18 agents
made 9 kinds of video (promo, explainer, data story, UI demo, whiteboard, code explainer, logo sting, year recap,
vertical short); blind AI judges gave them 7.1 out of 10 on average, none below 6, and their notes led to about 20
engine fixes. Every round and what it changed is in [`docs/experiments/`](docs/experiments/).

**9. Same input, same video.** Frames are a pure function of time, and 1 worker and N workers produce the same bytes;
the test suite checks it. That is what makes the reuse in point 1 safe. One known case still differs on macOS (a fade
combined with a move on text can be one color level off between worker counts), and it's on the fix list.

**10. Small and private.** givemotion has zero npm dependencies (installing it adds one package), sends no usage
data, and never needs an account. It renders wherever Node runs, and once Chrome is installed it works offline.

## What it doesn't do yet

- **No cloud rendering.** It renders on your machine or your server. HyperFrames and Remotion both run on AWS Lambda
  and Google Cloud Run.
- **No visual editor.** `givemotion dev` is a preview (timeline, scrubbing, frame stepping, sound), not an editor.
  Your agent is the editor. If you want to drag things around yourself, the HyperFrames desktop app and Remotion
  Studio do more.
- **No voice or transcription tools.** Bring your own voice-over and a word-timed captions file or `.srt`.
- **No HDR or HLS output.**
- **Slow on heavy pages without a GPU.** Pages with many full-screen effects render slowly on machines without one.
- **Speed on a Mac is not benchmarked yet.** All our timing numbers come from Linux cloud machines (see below).
- **It's new.** The community is small, and options may still change between 0.x versions.

## How it compares

Three tools turn HTML in headless Chrome into video: **givemotion**, **HyperFrames** (by HeyGen) and **Remotion**.
All three encode with ffmpeg. Here is where they differ, from each project's own docs, license and repository.
Checked on 27 October 2026 (HyperFrames 0.8.209, Remotion 4.0.539); these projects move fast, so tell us if something

### Tested with AI agents (givemotion vs Remotion)

Fresh Claude Opus agents made the same 9 briefs (promo, explainer, data story, UI demo, whiteboard, code explainer,
logo sting, year recap, vertical short), twice each, once with givemotion and once with Remotion 4.0.538, in
October 2026. 27 blind AI judges scored the 36 videos, 4 at a time per brief. HyperFrames has not been through this
test yet; it's next.

| | givemotion | Remotion |
|---|---|---|
| Judges' overall score (1-10) | **7.2** | 6.8 |
| Briefs won | 5 of 9 | 4 of 9 |
| Render time for all 18 videos (4 CPUs, no GPU) | **547 s** | 1102 s |
| Same animation in both tools, default settings | **14.6 s** | 27.1 s |
| Code the agent wrote per video (median) | **240 lines** | 617 lines |

The quality edge is small and mostly fewer visible mistakes; Remotion won the year recap, explainer, whiteboard and
promo briefs. The speed edge is larger: givemotion rendered every video faster. These are AI judges looking at frames,
on one machine, and the test harness and raw scores are not in this repository yet, so read this as our report, not
yet a benchmark you can rerun. givemotion agents also read more context per video (we estimate 10-20% more cost in
tokens at list prices), which we are working to bring down. The test used Remotion only as a user does.

### Speed vs HyperFrames

The same GSAP animation (10 s at 1080p) on a small cloud machine with 2 CPUs and no GPU: givemotion 22.2 s,
HyperFrames 0.8.188 36.8 to 40.0 s at the same quality. That's one animation on one machine, and HyperFrames has faster
capture paths we could not test there. The script is in [`benchmarks/vs-hyperframes`](benchmarks/vs-hyperframes)
so you can run it yourself. We have not yet run all three tools on the same machine, or on a Mac.

### Which one to pick

**Pick givemotion if** you want an engine with no license conditions you can fork and sell, no dependencies and no
data sent anywhere; if your agent will make many small changes and you want each re-render to be quick; or if you want
checks that also look at pacing and motion-design tools built in.

**Pick HyperFrames if** you want the biggest feature set right now: cloud rendering, a desktop app, voice and
transcription tools, HDR and HLS output, a large block catalog, and a large community backed by HeyGen.

**Pick Remotion if** you or your team already work in React, you want its mature ecosystem (Lambda rendering, the
Player, years of examples), and its license fits your company size.

HyperFrames and Remotion are good projects and inspired parts of this one. givemotion shares the idea of turning a
web page into a video, not the code. We are not affiliated with either.

## Make your own version (fork it)

MIT means you can take this and build on it, keep your fork private, or sell it. The only condition is that the
license notice stays in. One idea we like: **a fork focused on one style.** For example a "whiteboard" edition, a
"tech launch" edition, or your company's brand edition:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add blocks in [`blocks/`](blocks) for your style: your title cards, your lower thirds, your charts, your
   transitions, in your colors and fonts. Put your fonts in `src/runtime/fonts/`, with an `@font-face` for each in
   `src/runtime/preset.css`, so every render has them.
3. Add your look to the agent instructions. [`skills/givemotion/references/styles.md`](skills/givemotion/references/styles.md)
   holds the built-in looks; add yours with the blocks to use, the colors, the fonts, the motion personality and what
   to avoid. Point to it from [`SKILL.md`](skills/givemotion/SKILL.md) so the agent reads it first.
4. Ship it with `npx givemotion skill` (or your own package name), so your team's agents get your edition.

Agents then make videos in that style faster and more consistently, because they start from pieces that already look
right instead of inventing everything each time. You get most of what people hope for from "fine-tuning a model on
our brand", without training anything.

For a single project you may not need a fork: copy blocks into the project with `npx givemotion add <name>`, edit them
to your brand, and write your rules into the project's `AGENTS.md`.

## Where it's going

givemotion is maintained as an independent project and improved in rounds: agents make real videos, judges score
them, and what went wrong becomes engine fixes and better docs. The open work is public in
[`docs/NEXT.md`](docs/NEXT.md). Near the top of the list:

- publish the agent-test harness, and put HyperFrames through the same test;
- benchmark all three tools on one machine, including a Mac;
- fix the open macOS determinism case;
- lower the token cost per video for agents;
- find a fair way to measure whether natural motion looks better.

If you use it, the most useful thing you can send is a video that came out wrong, with the HTML. Issues and pull
requests are welcome.

## Questions people ask

**Is there a free, open-source way to turn code into video?** Yes. givemotion (MIT) and HyperFrames (Apache 2.0) are
both free for any use, including big companies. Remotion is free for individuals and companies of up to 3 people.
See [How it compares](#how-it-compares).

**Is it a free alternative to Remotion?** It does the same job (code in, video out) with HTML instead of React,
under MIT for everyone. In our test it rendered about 2× faster and scored a little higher; see
[How it compares](#how-it-compares).

**How is it different from HyperFrames?** Both are free and both use HTML. givemotion re-renders only what changed,
has no dependencies, sends no data, needs no account and is independent of any company. HyperFrames has far more
features today (cloud rendering, a desktop app, voice tools) and a much larger community.

**Can Claude Code make videos?** Yes. Run `npx givemotion init` (or `npx givemotion skill` in an existing
project) and ask Claude Code for a video. It also works with Cursor, Codex and other agents that read an
`AGENTS.md` file.

**If I don't like one part, does the whole video render again?** No. The agent edits that part, and only the 1-2
second pieces of the video that changed are rendered again. The result is the same file you would get from a full
render.

**Do I need to know how to code?** No. You talk to your agent; the agent writes the code. If you do know HTML
and CSS, you can open the file and change anything.

**Can I use it for client work or commercially?** Yes, for free, at any company size. MIT license.

**Can I build my own video product on it?** Yes. You can embed it, run it on your servers, fork it and sell the fork.

**Can I put my own music, voice-over, logos and videos in?** Yes. Audio tracks with volume curves and ducking
under a voice, video clips, images, fonts, and captions from a word-timed file or an `.srt`.

**How fast is it?** Fast on a normal computer, faster with more cores and a GPU. It renders with several browsers
at once, skips frames that did not change, and re-renders only the parts you changed. See [Performance](#performance).

**Who made it?** [Leonardo Grigorio](https://github.com/leonardogrig) started it in 2026. It's an independent
open-source project, and contributions are welcome.

No imports and no build step: the runtime is added for you. Everything that moves on a web page is played
on a virtual clock and captured frame by frame: CSS animations, transitions, the Web Animations API, timers,
`requestAnimationFrame`, canvas, WebGL, GSAP, Lottie. There is also a built-in GSAP-style timeline
(`gm.timeline()`), a camera (`gm.camera()`), path travel, shape morphs, `gm.fly()` (move an element in from where
another one is), live line charts (`gm.chart.line()`), hand-drawn shapes (`data-sketch`), labels pinned to shapes
(`data-anchor`), particle bursts, and music analysis (`gm.audio()`, `gm.beat(n)`, `data-pulse`, cuts written in beats).

The full reference is the skill pack written for agents (and good for humans too):
[`skills/givemotion/SKILL.md`](skills/givemotion/SKILL.md) and the topic files in
[`skills/givemotion/references/`](skills/givemotion/references).

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `init [dir]` | New project: starter video, agent instructions, AGENTS.md |
| `skill` | Add the agent instructions to an existing project |
| `dev [file]` | Live preview with a timeline, scrubbing, frame stepping and sound |
| `render [file] -o out.mp4` | Render to `.mp4` `.webm` `.mov` `.gif`, a folder of PNGs, or just the soundtrack (`.mp3`) |
| `still [file] -t 2.5 -o f.png` | One exact frame |
| `check [file]` | Problems with fixes, plus the motion strip |
| `snapshot [file]` | Key moments of every scene in one image |
| `inspect [file]` | Timeline as JSON; `--at 3.2 --el "#logo"` says where anything is at any moment |
| `audio <file>` | Tempo, beats, bar starts and big hits of a song |
| `captions <file>` | The caption pages a word-timed `.json` or `.srt` will show, so you can pick how many words per page |
| `analyze <video.mp4>` | Report on any video (a reference, or your render): shots and cuts, transitions, camera, pacing, colors, cuts on the beat, contact sheets. `--compare ref.mp4` lists how yours differs |
| `bundle [file] -o dir` | Standalone page + `<gm-player>` to embed the video in any site |
| `blocks` / `add <name>` | Ready-made blocks you can copy and edit |
| `install` / `doctor` / `bench` | Get Chrome, check your setup, measure speed (and what makes a page slow to draw) |

Render options: `--quality draft|standard|high|max`, `--fps`, `--scale 2` (4K from a 1080p layout; `4/3` for 1440p),
`--frames 2s-5s`, `--transparent`, `--motion-blur 8|auto`, `--codec h265|av1`, `--hardware`, `--workers`,
`--muted`, `--data file.json`, `--props '{…}'`, `--cache-dir <dir>` (where the parts cache lives),
`--progress json` (JSON progress lines on stderr, for apps). Every command takes `--json`.

Rendering again after a change only redoes the parts of the video that changed (edit one scene → only its 1-2 s parts
are rendered; in one long scene, an edit to something that appears at 40 s keeps the first 40 s), and the result is
byte-identical to a full render. `--redo 4s-7s` forces a range, `--no-cache` turns it off. The render result says
how many parts were reused, and `parts.lateOff` says why the finer reuse inside a long scene was turned off, if it was.

### Programmatic API

```js
import { render, check, snapshot, still, inspect } from 'givemotion';

await render('video.html', { output: 'out/video.mp4', quality: 'high', data: { name: 'Ada' } });
const report = await check('video.html');           // { ok, errors, warnings, issues: [...] }
const { sheet } = await snapshot('video.html');     // path to the contact sheet
```

### Blocks

Plain-HTML building blocks you copy into your project and edit freely (`npx givemotion add <name>`):
title-card, lower-third, captions, code-window, bar-chart, line-chart, stat, checklist, steps, browser-window,
phone, cursor, callout, compare, quote, word-pop, logo-reveal, end-card, gradient-bg, grid-bg, lottie.

### Performance

Measured on a small cloud machine (2 CPUs, no GPU), 1080p at 30 fps, 300 frames:

| | Time |
|---|---|
| Simple approach: one browser, PNG screenshots, no frame reuse | 32.7 s |
| givemotion, 1 worker | 15.0 s |
| givemotion, auto workers | 13.3 s |

On a 4-CPU cloud machine without a GPU (October 2026), that same test page renders in 14.6 s (22.6 s with one
worker), and the 18 videos agents made in our latest test round (5 to 31 s long, 1080p) rendered at 18.8 frames per
second on average. Pages with many full-screen effects are slower on machines without a GPU. Run
`npx givemotion bench` on your own computer.

Where the speed comes from: Chrome's frame-by-frame capture (`beginFrame`, on Linux and Windows), several
browsers rendering parts of the video at once, reusing frames that did not change, re-rendering only the parts that
changed, and encoding while capturing.

**On a Mac** it uses the GPU for drawing, and the Mac's hardware video encoder (VideoToolbox) for MP4 by default,
once a quick one-time check shows the encoder gives the same bytes every time (so renders stay exact and re-renders
can reuse parts). `npx givemotion doctor` says which encoder you get; `--no-hardware` turns it off. Frame capture
on macOS uses screenshots, because Chrome's frame-by-frame capture is not available there. We have not published Mac
timings yet.

### How it works

```
HTML ──► local server (adds the runtime, expands blocks and {{data}}, serves video frames)
           │
           ▼
 headless Chrome × N  ── runtime: virtual clock, seeks every animation to the exact time
           │  capture each frame
           ▼
      ffmpeg × N (1-2 s parts, fingerprinted, reused when unchanged) ──► join + audio mix ──► out.mp4
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- ffmpeg on your PATH (`brew install ffmpeg`, `sudo apt install ffmpeg`, `winget install ffmpeg`)
- Chrome: `npx givemotion install` downloads it, or it finds the one you have
- Only for React compositions: `npm i -D esbuild react react-dom` in your project

givemotion itself has **zero npm dependencies**: installing it adds one package.

### Status

givemotion is young (0.x). Compositions written today should keep working, but options and APIs may still
change between minor versions; changes are listed in the release notes.

## Contributing and security

Pull requests and issues are welcome: see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the
code layout). A composition is code that runs in Chrome; if you render compositions or data from people you don't
trust, read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) first. Report security problems privately, as described there.
